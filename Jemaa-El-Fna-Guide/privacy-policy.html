        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Jemaa El Fna Guide integrates the following third-party services, each of which has its own privacy policy and data practices:</p>

        <p><strong>Google AdMob</strong></p>
        <p>
            We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the app. AdMob may collect and use data including your advertising identifier, IP address, and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. You can review Google's privacy practices at:
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Apple Advertising &gt; Turn off Personalized Ads</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Apple Maps / Google Maps</strong></p>
        <p>
            Navigation links in the app open Apple Maps or Google Maps. When you follow these links, the respective map application's privacy policy applies. We do not share any data with mapping services beyond what you initiate by tapping a navigation button.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Expo (React Native)</strong></p>
        <p>
            The app is built using Expo and React Native. Expo may collect anonymized diagnostic data for platform stability purposes. See <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://expo.dev/privacy</a> for details.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            The app itself does not use cookies. However, third-party advertising partners (such as Google AdMob) may use tracking technologies, including mobile advertising identifiers, to deliver and measure advertisements. These technologies are governed by the respective third-party privacy policies.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We do not maintain any servers or databases that store personal data from users. Any data collected by third-party services (such as AdMob) is retained according to their respective data retention policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            App preferences (such as your selected language and display settings) are stored locally on your device and can be cleared at any time by uninstalling the app.

        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect any information associated with our app. Since we do not collect or store personal data on our own servers, the primary security responsibility rests with the third-party services we use. We encourage you to review the security practices of those services.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>

Data processed by third-party services (such as Google AdMob) may be transferred to and stored in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States. These transfers are conducted in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including Standard Contractual Clauses where required under GDPR.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
