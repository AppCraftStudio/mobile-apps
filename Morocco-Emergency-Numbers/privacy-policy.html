        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Morocco Emergency Numbers</strong> ("the App", "we", "us", or "our").
            This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application,
            available on iOS and Android.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are committed to protecting your privacy. Please read this policy carefully to understand
            our practices.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. About the App</h2>
        <p>
            Morocco Emergency Numbers is an offline reference app that provides tourists and travelers
            in Morocco with quick access to emergency phone numbers, safety guides, embassy contacts,
            and related information in multiple languages.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            The App is designed to work <strong>completely offline</strong>. All emergency data,
            guides, and embassy information are bundled within the App and do not require an
            internet connection.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong>
            The App does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any
            personal details.
        </p>
        <p>The App stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your selected language preference</li>
            <li>Your selected display theme (light or dark mode)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These preferences are saved using your device's local storage and never leave your device.
            They can be cleared at any time by uninstalling the App.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, process, or share any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name, email address, or contact information</li>
            <li>Location or GPS data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or crash reports</li>
            <li>Camera, microphone, or contacts data</li>
            <li>Any sensitive or financial information</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Internet Access</h2>
        <p>
            The App requests internet access permission to enable optional features such as
            opening external links (e.g., embassy websites or legal pages) in your device's browser.
            No data is transmitted by the App itself during these interactions &mdash; your browser
            handles external links independently.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking,
            or data collection SDKs. No data is shared with any third party.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13
            (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). As the App collects
            no personal data whatsoever, it is safe for users of all ages.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since the App does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no personal data
            at risk. Preferences stored locally on your device are protected by your device's
            own security mechanisms.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights under applicable data protection laws
            (such as GDPR or CCPA). Since we collect no personal data, there is no personal
            information held by us to access, correct, or delete.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to remove locally stored preferences, simply uninstall the App from your
            device.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
            by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to
            review this policy periodically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the
            updated policy.
