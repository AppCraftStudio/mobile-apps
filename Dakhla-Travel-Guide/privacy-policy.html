            <strong>Summary:</strong> Dakhla Travel Guide does not collect, store, or share any personal
            information. All your preferences are saved locally on your device only.

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Dakhla Travel Guide</strong> ("the App"), operated by the Dakhla Travel Guide
            team ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use
            our mobile application, available on iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play).
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree,
            please discontinue use of the App.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> The App is a read-only travel
            guide that functions entirely offline for its core content. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not require you to create an account or log in.</li>
            <li>We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifier.</li>
            <li>We do not collect your location data.</li>
            <li>We do not track your usage behavior or in-app activity.</li>
            <li>We do not use advertising SDKs or ad tracking.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
        <p>
            The App saves the following preferences <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> using
            standard local storage (AsyncStorage). This data never leaves your device and is never
            transmitted to us or any third party:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Language preference</strong> – your selected display language.</li>
            <li><strong>Appearance preference</strong> – your selected light or dark theme.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can clear this data at any time by uninstalling the App.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App may open external links (such as the Privacy Policy page) in your device's browser
            using the system web browser. We have no control over the privacy practices of external
            websites and encourage you to review their individual privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The App uses the following third-party frameworks and services solely for app delivery and
            functionality — none of which are configured to collect personal data through this App:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Expo / React Native</strong> – the framework used to build and deliver the App.
                Expo may collect anonymous crash and diagnostic data to improve their platform. See
                <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expo's Privacy Policy</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Apple App Store / Google Play</strong> – distribution platforms that may collect
                device information in accordance with their own policies.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Maps and Location</h2>
        <p>
            The App displays map previews of locations in Dakhla, Morocco. These maps are rendered using
            device-native map libraries and <strong>do not request or use your device's GPS or location
            services</strong>. No location data is collected or transmitted.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in the European Economic
            Area). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the App collects
            no personal information from anyone, it is safe for general audiences. If you believe a child has
            provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will address the matter
            promptly.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Because we do not collect or store any personal data on external servers, there is no data at
            risk on our end. Preferences stored locally on your device are protected by your device's own
            security mechanisms (e.g., device encryption and passcode protection).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on your country or region, you may have rights relating to your personal data under
            laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy
            Act (CCPA). Since we do not collect or process any personal data, these rights — including the
            right to access, correct, or delete personal data — do not typically apply. However, if you have
            any questions or concerns, please contact us using the details below.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last
            updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Your
            continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
