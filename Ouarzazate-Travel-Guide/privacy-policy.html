<main>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Ouarzazate Travel Guide</strong> ("the App", "we", "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
    </div>

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>
        Ouarzazate Travel Guide is a mobile travel guide application that provides information about destinations, kasbahs, film studios, desert experiences, and travel planning tips related to Ouarzazate, Morocco. The App is available on iOS (Apple App Store) and Android (Google Play Store).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We are committed to minimizing data collection. The App does not require account registration and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
    </p>
    <p>The following types of information may be processed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Device-stored preferences:</strong> Your selected language, display theme (light/dark mode), and saved favorite places are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Advertising data:</strong> The App displays banner advertisements provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect and process data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. This may include your device's advertising identifier (IDFA on iOS, GAID on Android), IP address, and general usage information. See Section 5 for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage data:</strong> Aggregated, non-identifiable analytics may be collected by platform services (Apple App Store / Google Play) to help us understand general app performance. We do not have access to individual user data through these services.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The App uses information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To display travel content and information relevant to Ouarzazate, Morocco.</li>
        <li>To remember your in-app preferences (language, theme, saved places) locally on your device.</li>
        <li>To display banner advertisements that help support the App's development and maintenance.</li>
        <li>To improve the App's performance and user experience through aggregated analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        All user preferences (saved places, language, theme) are stored exclusively on your local device. No personal data is transmitted to or stored on our servers. We do not operate any backend servers that collect user data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because preferences are stored locally, uninstalling the App will erase all locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services – Google AdMob</h2>
    <p>
        The App integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> (provided by Google LLC) to display advertising. AdMob may collect the following types of data to serve relevant advertisements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device advertising identifiers (IDFA / GAID)</li>
        <li>IP address and approximate location (country/region level)</li>
        <li>Device type, operating system version, and language</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Google AdMob's data collection and use is governed by Google's Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        On iOS devices, the App complies with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. You may be asked for permission before your advertising identifier is used for personalized advertising. You can change this preference at any time in your device's Settings under Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Android devices, you can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting your device's Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The advertising displayed in the App is provided by Google AdMob. We configure AdMob to serve non-personalized ads in contexts where children may be present, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google's Families Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and deletion:</strong> Since we do not collect personal data on our servers, all locally stored preferences can be deleted by uninstalling the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising opt-out:</strong> You may opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings as described in Section 5.</li>
        <li><strong>GDPR (European users):</strong> If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation, including the right to access, rectify, and erase personal data. Since we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, these rights primarily apply to data handled by third-party services such as Google AdMob.</li>
        <li><strong>CCPA (California users):</strong> If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information is collected and to opt out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We do not retain personal data on any servers. User preferences stored locally on your device persist until you uninstall the App or clear the App's data from your device settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data collected by Google AdMob is subject to Google's own data retention policies.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
    <p>
        The App is available globally. If you are using the App from outside Morocco, please be aware that any data handled by third-party services (such as Google AdMob) may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States. By using the App, you consent to such transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Links to External Websites</h2>
    <p>
        The App may contain links to external websites or services (such as maps). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
